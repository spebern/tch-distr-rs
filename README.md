# tch-distr-rs

This is an attempt of mimicking the python `torch.distributions` module. 

Rust has a very good wrapper around `libtorch`: [https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs](tch-rs). 
However, the `torch.distributions` module only exists in python and therefore needs to
be implemented in rust which is a lot of work. Also, the python module is very well tested.

To ease the work for porting the distributions `tch-distr-rs`'s output is tested against
the python implementations.

If you want to help out and implement a missing distribution feel free to add it, implement
the `Distribution` trait and include some tests in `tests/against_python.rs`.

Currently, the `Distribution` trait is not stable and it will most likely change (Suggestions welcome!).


# Notes on the tests

The tests require nightly, because of the python wrapper `pyo3` and also the python `torch` library.

On arch linux the tests segfaulted for me when I used the `aur/libtorch` together with tch, which
seems to have been a conflict between the python `torch` and `libtorch`.

Using `community/python-pytorch` instead worked for me.
